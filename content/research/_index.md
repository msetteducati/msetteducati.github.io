# Quantitative Simulation Model Validation

During the second semester of my senior year, I completed my capstone research project. 
I worked with two faculty members, Dr. Olsen and Dr. Raunak, on creating a framework used to quantitatively validate a 
given simulation model. 
Dr. Olsen and Dr. Raunak then presented this work at the 2018 Summer Simulation Conference, and a 
[related paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325825357_Enabling_Quantified_Validation_for_Model_Credibility)
was published at its conclusion.

My primary role in the project was to develop a web application that researchers in the Modeling and Simulation field can use to quantitatively validate their own models. 
I created the application using Angular 5 on the frontend, and Python and Flask on the backend. 
I used MongoDB as the database to store user credentials and user created models. 
I did not know much about these technologies at the beginning of the semester, but learned a lot about them throughout the duration of the project. 

During the course of the project, I was required to write various papers documenting the project. 
These papers were ultimately combined into a final report, which can be viewed 
[here](/research/quantitative-measurements-model-credibility.pdf).
I also presented my work which can be viewed
