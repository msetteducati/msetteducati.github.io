## Hi there, my name is Mike

I am a Software Engineer at Meta within the Central Product Foundations org. I primarily work on product infra related to youth safety. 

Previously, I was a Lead Software Engineer at Amount, where I primarily worked on designing and implementing backend microservices written in Java and Go.
